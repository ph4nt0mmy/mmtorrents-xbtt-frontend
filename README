mmtorrents-xbtt-frontend
-------------------------

This is a frontend written in PHP/MySQL/JS/HTML from scratch (except for the 3rdparty tools and some existing public libraries), which I started to develop to be used as a frontend for XBT Tracker. Sadly I didn't have the time to complete the frontend, so it's not ready yet. Now I'm sharing it with you under GPLv3 license. The GPLv3 license only applies to my code, where I used other public codes, there the license remains the original, no matter what it is.

Features:
- multilang support (currently it has English and Hungarian support)
- uses btemplate HTML template class so you can easily create you're own themes
- uses lightbenc to generate .torrent files which makes the process faster than other methods
- a lots of AJAX features
- TinyMCE editor for nicely formatted torrent descriptions/posts/etc

What is ready:
- uploading torrents
- downloading torrents
- user registration

What is not:
- everything else :(
- the main missing component: there's no administration capability yet

How to install:
- install a webserver with PHP (GD library is needed!) and MySQL support and create a vhost for the frontend or just put it in the server's root directory
- open your php.ini an set short_open_tag = On
- create a MySQL DB and import sql/mm6.sql file
- edit inc/config.inc.php
- point your browser to your webserver



Try out and if you like it consider to participate in development of the code. Thanks
